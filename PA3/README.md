#COVID OUTBREAK GAME
This game contains multiple kinds of objects: Buildings (could be either Doctors Offices or Classrooms) and Students. 
Doctors Offices contain a certain amount of vaccines that can be given to students, and Classrooms contain a certain number of assignments 
that need to be completed by the Students to win the game. 
Students have a limited amount of antibodies that is decremented whenever they move around or complete assignments. If a student runs 
out of antibodies, the student becomes infected and is then removed from the game.
The locations of the objects in the game can be tracked with an ASCII grid.
The goal of the game is to complete all the assignments in the classrooms and win the game.
If all students are infected, the user loses the game.
