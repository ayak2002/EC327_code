Code written for EC 327: Intro to Software Engineering at Boston University (Fall 2021)
This repository contains all the code that I have written for all four programming assignments for the class
EC327: Introduction to Software Engineering at Boston University in Fall 2021. The first two programming assignments contain a variety of C++ problems. The third programming assignment
is a game called COVID OUTBREAK, and the fourth programming assignment is the continuation of the game (includes
upgrades like new objects and code adjustments).
